# ## How to draw functions in Python
# 
# When you start developing a Machine Learning model, it is usally convenient either to work with toy datasets (small datasets on which you can perform the desired task, but not complicated) or to generate a synthetic dataset to test your model on.
# 
# So, even if it's not a "required skill" to become a Data Scientist, it's always good to know ho to play with mathematical objects, also because it gives you a better understanding of the problem.
# 
# As usual in Python, let's start by importing the `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries: 

# In[141]:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# When you define a line in Math, you usually use a formula like the following:
# 
# $$ y = 2x+5$$
# 
# then, to draw it, you usually assign two values to $x$ and see the corresponding value of $y$:
# 
# | x | y |
# |---|---|
# | 0 | 5 |
# | 1 | 15|
# 
# Now you can plot the two points on your carthesian plane and draw a line between them, maybe using dashes at the extreme of the line to give a sense of "infinity" somehow.
# 
# We can do it in Python too, by using `plt.plot()` function:

# In[148]:


plt.plot([0,1], [5,15])


# But what if you want to draw a more complicate curve? It's an hard task if you do it on paper. For example: let's say that you want to draw $sin(x)$. Ok, you know how it looks like. It's like a wave. You just need to remember what is the value of $sin(0)$ (*i.e.* 0) and the rest is kinda free.
# 
# How do you communicate it to a computer? It doesn't have your drawing skills (yet)!
# 
# However, the previous idea is fine: assign values to the $x$ and check the value of the $y$. Let's try with some value:
# 
# $$y = sin(x)$$
# 
# | x  | y |
# |----|---|
# | 0  | 0 |
# | Ï€/2| 1 |
# | Ï€  | 0 |
# |3/2Ï€| -1|
# | 2Ï€ | 0 |
# 

# In[150]:


x = [0, np.pi/2, np.pi, 3/2*np.pi, 2*np.pi]
y = [0, 1, 0, -1, 0]


# In[151]:


plt.plot(x,y)


# It doesn't look like a sinusoid :(
# But I like the idea. Stick with it. Add more points.
# 
# | x  | y |
# |----|---|
# | 0  | 0 |
# | Ï€/4| âˆš2/2 |
# | Ï€/2| 1 |
# |3/4Ï€ | âˆš2/2 |
# | Ï€  | 0 |
# |5/4Ï€ | -âˆš2/2|
# |3/2Ï€| -1|
# |7/4Ï€ | -âˆš2/2 |
# | 2Ï€ | 0 |
# 
# 

# In[162]:


x = [0, np.pi/4, np.pi/2, 3/4*np.pi, np.pi, 5/4*np.pi, 3/2*np.pi, 7/4*np.pi, 2*np.pi]
y = [0, np.sqrt(2)/2, 1, np.sqrt(2)/2, 0, -np.sqrt(2)/2, -1, - np.sqrt(2)/2, 0]


# In[163]:


plt.plot(x,y)


# We are getting closer! If we could find 1000 points, maybe... it would look better...
# 
# There's a way to do it! Look at this: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.linspace.html
# 
# 

# In[165]:


x = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi, 1000)
x


# So our `x` in the cell above contains 1000 points equally spaced between 0 and 2Ï€! How do we compute the value of the $sin$ for each of them? Well:

# In[171]:


y = np.sin(x)


# In[172]:


y


# Hooray! We have 1000 points now! Let's plot them:

# In[173]:


plt.plot(x,y)


# Well done! Time to watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlM7gsUY9Gw
# 
# *10 hours later...*
# 
# 
# Let's have fun extending the interval of x:

# In[11]:


import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(-10*np.pi, 10*np.pi, 1000)
y = np.cos(x)


# In[12]:


plt.plot(x, y)


# The cool thing is that you can repeat this reasoning for many functions! Let's see this for a parabola:
# 
# $$y=x^{2}$$

# In[180]:


x = np.linspace(-50,50, 1000)
y = x**2


# In[13]:


plt.plot(x,y)


# What about this?
# 
# $$y = \cos(-x^{9}) - \log(x^{6}) + \sin(\pi x^{2}) + \cos(2\pi x)+ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\pi}$$

# In[239]:


x = np.linspace(-100, 100, 1000)
y = np.cos(-x**9) -np.log(x**6) + np.sin(np.pi*x**2) - np.sin(x) + np.cos(np.pi*2*x) + np.sqrt(2)/np.pi


# In[240]:


plt.plot(x, y)


# It reminds me this: ![image](https://techweez.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dog.jpg)

# Draw the dog:

# In[250]:


plt.plot(x, y)
plt.scatter([0], [-20], c="r")


# ## Derivative

# We can compute the derivative of functions by using `scipy`:

# In[ ]:


# On your terminal
# conda install scipy


# In[255]:


from scipy.misc import derivative


# Since the derivative is computed for a function, scipy asks us to wrap the formula we defined above into a function. Let's take the $\sin$ for example:

# In[256]:


def sin(x):
    return np.sin(x)


# Cool, now let's compute the derivative of it in the point $\pi$ by using:

# In[259]:


derivative(sin, np.pi, dx=1e-6)


# Since we are using a computer, we need to deal with approximation. This is why you specify dx as well and this is why you don't get -1, but -1.0000000001396114. So, how can we draw it?
# 
# We know that the derivative of $sin(x)$ is $cos(x)$. As we did before, we can define the values for $x$, then we compute the derivative of the function for those values too!

# In[263]:


x = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi, 1000)
plt.plot(x, sin(x))


# In[264]:


sin_derivative = derivative(sin, x, dx=1e-6)


# In[265]:


plt.plot(x, sin_derivative)


# Is that... cosine?? ðŸ˜±

# In[266]:


def cos(x):
    return np.cos(x)

plt.plot(x, cos(x))


# They looks identifcal! Mission accomplished! Let's plot $sin(x)$ and its derivative in the same plot:

# In[269]:


plt.plot(x, sin(x))
plt.plot(x, sin_derivative)
plt.legend(["sin", "derivative of sin"])


# Let's try with $\log(x)$:

# In[271]:


def log(x):
    return np.log(x)

x = np.linspace(1, 100, 1000)
plt.plot(x, log(x))


# In[272]:


log_derivative = derivative(log, x, dx=1e-6)


# In[273]:


plt.plot(x, log_derivative)


# That is actually the plot of $\frac{1}{x}$!

# ## Exercises
# 
# 1. Plot the absolute value of x and its derivative. Choose an interval to have a nice looking shape.

# In[20]:


import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import numpy as np

x = np.linspace(start=-10, stop=10, num=100)

plt.plot(x, np.absolute(x))

plt.show()


# 2. Plot the function $x\log(x)$ and its derivative.

# In[30]:


from scipy.misc import derivative
abs_drv = derivative(abs, x, dx=1e-6)
plt.plot(x, abs_drv)


# 3. Plot the function $e^{x}\log(x)+5$ and its derivative.

# In[ ]:





# 4.(Harder) Plot the function $\sin(\frac{1}{2}x)+2$ in the interval \[0, $2\pi$\]. Plot in the same graph both the function and the tangent line to the points in which the function has derivative = 0.
